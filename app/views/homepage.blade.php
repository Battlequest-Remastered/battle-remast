	<p class="description">Developed in 1982, Battlequest (or "Battle Quest" as it was called in its original iteration) was responsible for the sudden boom of text-based adventure games in the mid to late 80's. It exceeded all theorised sales figures, taking the world (as well as the entertainment industry) by surprise. For the first time in history, crawling through dungeons and meeting wizards and dragons was something that could be done somewhere other than a tabletop.<br>
